# WhisperLink 🌌  
AI-Mediated Peer-to-Peer Safe Sharing for Youth Mental Wellness  

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
Youth today face stress, anxiety, and loneliness — but many hesitate to seek help due to stigma or fear of judgment.  
Current AI mental health tools mostly act as chatbots, which lack genuine community connection and empathy.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution
WhisperLink is a revolutionary mental wellness platform that creates a safe, anonymous digital "Whisper Wall" where youth can share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment.  

Our AI-powered system uses **Google’s Gemini** to:  
- Organize posts into relatable themes  
- Suggest empathetic, professionally-vetted peer responses  
- Foster genuine human connection while maintaining complete anonymity
